Computed Tomography (CT) imaging, while essential for diagnostics, exposes patients to ionizing radiation. To accurately quantify radiation dosage, this study introduces MIDSX, a specialized open-source Monte Carlo (MC) photon transport code system for x-ray transport in medical imaging. Unlike general purpose particle transport MC systems, MIDSX is tailored for x-ray transport, offering more streamlined implementation. Results from validation simulations show MIDSX's results for specific cases agree to within 0.32\% of the mean of established reference data. However, discrepancies in body energy deposition measurements, reaching up to a 6.3\% mean percent error, indicate areas for further refinement in the system.
